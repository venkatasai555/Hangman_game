# Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic single-player word guessing game implemented in Python. The player needs to guess the correct word by guessing individual letters, one at a time. The game will provide clues about the word's characters, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script `hangman_game.py` to start the game.
2. The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list of words.
3. The player needs to guess a letter by entering it through the command line or terminal.
4. The game will inform the player if the guessed letter is present in the word or not.
5. If the player guesses all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, they win the game.
6. If the player runs out of attempts before guessing the word, they lose the game.

## Prerequisites
To run this game, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Features
- Random word selection for each game.
- Clues provided about the word's characters.
- Limited attempts to increase the challenge.

## Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the list of words from which the game randomly selects. Additionally, you can adjust the number of attempts the player is allowed or introduce different difficulty levels.

## Implementation Details
The game is implemented using basic Python constructs, including:
- Loops: To handle iterations, such as repeating the game until the player wins or loses.
- Conditions: To check the validity of the player's input and determine if the guessed letter is correct.
- Functions: To encapsulate code logic and handle various game actions, like validating input, checking letters in the word, etc.
